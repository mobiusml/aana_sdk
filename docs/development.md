## Developing in a Dev Container

If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can run this repository in a 
[dev container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). This lets you install and 
run everything you need for the repo in an isolated environment via docker on a host system. 


## Databases
The project includes some useful tools for storing structured metadata in a SQL database.

The datastore uses SQLAlchemy as an ORM layer and Alembic for migrations. The migrations are run 
automatically at startup. If changes are made to the SQLAlchemy models, it is necessary to also 
create an alembic migration that can be run to upgrade the database. 
The easiest way to do so is as follows:

```bash
poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<Short description of changes in sentence form.>"
```

ORM models referenced in the rest of the code should be imported from `aana.models.db` directly,
not from that model's file for reasons explained in `aana/models/db/__init__.py`. This also means that 
if you add a new model class, it should be imported by `__init__.py` in addition to creating a migration.

Higher level code for interacting with the ORM is available in `aana.repository.data`.
