# Run with Docker

We provide a docker-compose configuration to run the application in a Docker container in [Aana App Template](https://github.com/mobiusml/aana_app_template).

Requirements:

- Docker Engine >= 26.1.0
- Docker Compose >= 1.29.2
- NVIDIA Driver >= 525.60.13

You can edit the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/mobiusml/aana_app_template/Dockerfile.yaml) if your application requires third-party libraries in os level.

To run the application, simply run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000` on the host server.


> **⚠️ Warning**
>
> If your applications requires GPU to run, you need to specify which GPU to use.
>
> The applications will detect the available GPU automatically but you need to make sure that `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` is set correctly.
> 
> Sometimes `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` is set to an empty string and the application will not be able to detect the GPU. Use `unset CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to unset the variable.
> 
> You can also set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to the GPU index you want to use: `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 docker-compose up`.


> **💡Tip**
>
> Some models use Flash Attention for better performance. You can set the build argument `INSTALL_FLASH_ATTENTION` to `true` to install Flash Attention. 
>
> ```bash
> INSTALL_FLASH_ATTENTION=true docker-compose build
> ```
>
> After building the image, you can use `docker-compose up` command to run the application.
>
> You can also set the `INSTALL_FLASH_ATTENTION` environment variable to `true` in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
